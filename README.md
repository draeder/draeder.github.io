# Simple P2P Social Network
An experimental effort to build a serverless, secure and fully decentralized peer-to-peer social network.

The service can run directly in a browser tab without any need for server hosting by simply downloading index.html and opening it in a browser.

At present, the service is completely experimental--testing and playing around with various decentralized APIs like the follwing:

- Bugout API (pre-alpha): A decentralized messenging API that connects peers together and is built upon WebTorrent and WebRTC.
- AvionDB (alpha): an offline first, mongo-like, security conscious decentralized database built upon OrbitDB and IPFS
- js-ipfs: storage for images and videos (may be replaced with AvionDB)
